#This program sorts a list by finding the smallest element and swapping
#it with the element in position zero of the list.It then finds the next
#smallest element and swaps it with the element in position one of the list.
#This process repeats until we have found the n -1 th smallest element and
#put it in position n - 2. At this point, the largest element is in position n - 1.
